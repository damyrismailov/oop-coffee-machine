Text-based coffee machine simulation using object-oriented Python.

## Main features

- Offers drinks such as espresso and latte.
- Tracks resources (water, milk, coffee).
- Accepts coins, checks payment and calculates change.
- Prints a report of remaining resources and profit.

## What I learned

- Designing and using classes for menu, coffee maker and money machine.
- Encapsulating data and behaviour inside objects.
- Building a simple command line interface around those objects.
